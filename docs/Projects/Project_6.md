In the modern era, technological advancements heavily rely on energy sources that are cost-effective, reliable, and energy-efficient. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a novel material, cobalt-incapacitated Prussian blue graphene ferrites composite (CO-PBGF), using the Hummers method, coprecipitation method, and hydrothermal technique.  

### Material Characterization  
- **X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD):** Confirmed the successful formation of the composite material.  
- **UV-Vis Spectroscopy:** Analyzed the π–π* transitions, revealing their impact on the material's properties.  
- **Photoluminescence (PL) Spectroscopy:** Investigated the crystallinity and delocalized electron movement between Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺, CO, and Prussian blue nanoparticles.  

### Dielectric and Electrical Properties  
- **Dielectric Constants:** Real and imaginary components were used to calculate capacitance and energy dissipation.  
- **Grain Boundaries:** Exhibited high resistivity at lower frequencies, requiring significant energy for charge transfer between grains.  
- **AC Conductivity:** Showed an increasing trend with applied frequency.  
- **Impedance Spectroscopy:** Characterized the interfaces of conducting electrodes, highlighting both electronic and ionic conduction.  
- **I-V Behavior:** Using the four-probe method, the electrical conductivity was analyzed. At 20 V, a current of 6 × 10⁻⁴ A was observed, demonstrating the material's conductive behavior.  

### Antimicrobial Activity  
The antimicrobial properties of the composite were evaluated. While graphene oxide (GO) exhibited a small inhibition zone, CO-PBGF demonstrated a significantly higher inhibition zone, confirming its superior antibacterial activity compared to GO.  

This research highlights the potential of CO-PBGF as a multifunctional material with promising applications in energy storage, electronics, and antimicrobial technologies.

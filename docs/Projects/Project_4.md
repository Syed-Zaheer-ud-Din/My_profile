### Antimicrobial activity of *Lantana camara* against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Serratia marcescens*, and *Staphylococcus aureus* to develop Ointment-Based Therapy Development

The use of plant-based and natural extracts, such as those derived from *Lantana camara* and earthworms (*Pheretima posthuma*), has been a cornerstone of traditional medicine for treating various ailments, including wound infections. These extracts are known for their ability to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and promote wound healing. This study investigates the antibacterial properties of organic extracts from these sources against specific bacterial strains, with the aim of exploring their potential in formulating antiseptic ointments.

The research employed ethanol and acetone as solvents for extraction, followed by antibacterial activity assessments using disk diffusion and shake flask methods. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts was determined for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Among the tested extracts, *Lantana camara* demonstrated the most significant inhibitory effect, particularly against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, with notable activity against *Serratia marcescens* and *Staphylococcus aureus* as well. The MIC values for the plant extract and earthworm extract were 150 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml, respectively.

The findings underscore the superior antimicrobial efficacy of the ethanol extract of *Lantana camara* compared to the earthworm extract. These results highlight the potential of *Lantana camara* as a key ingredient in the development of ointments aimed at treating wound infections effectively.

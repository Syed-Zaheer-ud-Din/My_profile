# Evolutionary Developmental Genetics

### Research Fellow | University of Göttingen  
**Location:** Göttingen, Germany  
**Duration:** January 2020 – 2021  

As a Research Fellow at the University of Göttingen, I contributed to advancing our understanding of evolutionary developmental genetics through a multidisciplinary approach. My work focused on the developmental and molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic novelties, specifically in the broad-horned beetle, *Gnathocerus cornutus*.  

### Key Contributions:
- Conducted detailed dissections and imaging using confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM) to identify critical developmental stages.
- Performed phenotyping with 2D and 3D landmarks, followed by multivariate analysis using R.
- Utilized next-generation sequencing to analyze differential gene expression.
- Executed molecular biology techniques, including cloning, in vitro transcription, dsRNA preparation, and larval injections.

### Research Overview:
Phenotypic novelties, which represent distinct traits not derived from ancestral features, play a crucial role in the diversity of life. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving these novelties remain poorly understood. My research centered on the sexually dimorphic head morphology of *G. cornutus*, a pest species exhibiting male-specific traits such as large mandibular horns, prominent genae, and vertex horns—features absent in females.  

Leveraging its close relationship to the model beetle *Tribolium castaneum*, I employed advanced genetic tools, including RNA interference, to investigate the developmental processes behind these traits.  

### Key Findings:
- Mandibular horns in *G. cornutus* develop during pre-pupal stages.
- Genome-wide expression analysis identified sexually differentially expressed candidate genes at critical post-embryonic stages.
- RNA interference experiments are ongoing to assess the functional roles of these candidate genes.
- Developed and optimized a head-clearing protocol to visualize head morphology across developmental stages and after gene knockdown using cLSM.

This research offers foundational insights into the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying the novel head morphology of *G. cornutus*. These findings enhance our understanding of the evolutionary processes driving phenotypic novelties, with additional candidate gene knockdown phenotypes currently under investigation.

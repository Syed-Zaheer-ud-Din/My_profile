Graphene and carbonaceous materials have garnered significant attention from scientists since the discovery of graphene. In this study, the properties of graphene/Fe₃O₄ (GF) composites were thoroughly investigated, revealing promising results in various domains.

### Structural and Spectroscopic Analysis
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis identified characteristic peaks of Fe₃O₄ at angles 26.33°, 29.93°, 35.02°, 44.01°, 54.65°, and 57.20°, corresponding to crystal planes (002), (220), (311), (400), (511), (422), and (440), respectively. These values align with the typical XRD pattern (JCPDS no. 88-0315). 

Raman spectroscopy revealed a peak at 1466 cm⁻¹ in the G band, corresponding to the E₂g mode, and a peak at 1301 cm⁻¹ in the D band, attributed to carbon atom vibrations. UV-Vis spectroscopy showed peaks due to π → π* and n → π* transitions, with a measured band gap of 2.89 eV. FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of functional groups such as epoxide, alkoxy, carboxylic, and hydroxyl (O-H), validating the formation of the GF composite.

### Electrical and Dielectric Properties
The AC conductivity of the material increased with the applied electric field frequency, reaching a value of 1.5 × 10⁻² S/m at 20 MHz. The shielding effectiveness (SET) values were measured at -18 dB within the 4–16 MHz range, varying with frequency. The reflective behavior remained consistent due to the induced electric field, while absorption behavior increased with frequency. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements demonstrated ohmic behavior, with a current of 2.9 × 10⁻³ A observed at 20 V.

### Antibacterial Activity
The GF composite exhibited significant antibacterial activity against various pathogens, highlighting its potential for biomedical applications.

### Conclusion
The graphene/Fe₃O₄ composite demonstrates high electrical conductivity, robust EMI shielding effectiveness, and notable antibacterial properties. These findings suggest its suitability for applications in electronics, biomedicine, and advanced material science.

**Abstract:**  
This study investigates the genetic basis of appendage differentiation in insects through RNA-expression meta-analysis and gene knockdown experiments. Transcriptome data from _Tribolium castaneum_, _Heliconius melpomene_, and _Danaus plexippus_ revealed 371 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between antennae and legs, and 278 DEGs among leg tissues. Co-expression analysis identified key networks and hub genes, with Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis highlighting antennae-specific heat sensing and leg-specific muscular pathways. Functional analysis of the conserved distal-less (dll) gene in Gnathocerus cornutus demonstrated its critical role in appendage development, with significant leg reduction observed in knockdown experiments. These findings provide insights into appendage evolution and potential applications in pest management.

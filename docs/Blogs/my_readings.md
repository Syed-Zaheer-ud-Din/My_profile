 In 2020, I was in Germany, browsing a store like a tourist with a mission. I left with two gadgets: an iPad (meh) and a Kindle (YES!). Turns out, the Kindle became the best choise Fast-forward to 2025: making this website, and Iâ€™ve read SO MANY books as hobby that my brainâ€™s basically a walking Wikipedia entry. I will share my  book reviews now on to track of them. Why? Because libraries are like book hoardersâ€”99% of their stash is a trash beleive me. Letâ€™s be real: youâ€™ve got time for ~12,000 books in your life. Hit that magic number, and congratulations, youâ€™re now a robot whoâ€™s never laughed. So hereâ€™s my mission: help you skip the fluff, find your jam, and savor every page-turning moment. Letâ€™s dive into my favesâ€¦  enjoy. ðŸ“šâœ¨ :-)


## The Dream of a Ridiculous Man by Fyodor Dostoevsky     (May 2025)
Before reading this, I always thought the real world was far more fascinating than fiction. yes as man of science we are quite sure about this but this fiction also moved me. As someone with a scientific background, scientific method's focus on disproving falsehoods to be deeply compelling. We accept that we can only know what is not true, it is the foundation of our understanding. this novel is I would say critique to that i know its red flag, no its not that way writer is genius not that flag he started with existansialsim, he is very much aware of what he is doing, Still i would say writer is genius must read        
         
Dostoevsky's story centers on a deeply disillusioned man who views himself as "ridiculous" due to his perceived failures and the futility of his existence. Consumed by despair, he contemplates suicide, attempting to end his life. Surviving the attempt, he experiences a transformative dream in which he travels to a utopian planet. Here, its inhabitants live in innocence, free from the corruption and suffering plaguing Earth. However, when he shares his knowledge of human vices with them, their paradise collapses into chaos, mirroring humanity's fall from grace. Upon awakening, the protagonist undergoes a profound moral awakening. Recognizing the potential for redemption and goodness in humanity, he dedicates his life to altruism, seeking to alleviate the suffering of others.
This book really inspired me becuse of writer Dostoevsky's writing is exceptionalâ€”I wish I could write my thesis with the same depth and insight. If you're going to read this, I would recommend having a little knowledge about existentialism, the Enlightenment period in Europe, and Christianity (suffering, utopia, etc.), as these themes are central to the narrative. Dostoevsky made me experience something I had lost during the rational and empirical nature of myself.  but still This story moved me to tears when describing the utopian world, evoking feelings I hadn't experienced since I embraced a more rational worldview. (must have experience of humanity)

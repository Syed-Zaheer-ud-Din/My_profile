 In 2020, I was in Germany, browsing a store like a tourist with a mission. I left with two gadgets: an iPad (meh) and a Kindle (YES!). Turns out, the Kindle became the best choise Fast-forward to 2025: making this website, and Iâ€™ve read SO MANY books as hobby that my brainâ€™s basically a walking Wikipedia entry. I will share my  book reviews now on to track of them. Why? Because libraries are like book hoardersâ€”99% of their stash is a trash beleive me. Letâ€™s be real: youâ€™ve got time for ~12,000 books in your life. Hit that magic number, and congratulations, youâ€™re now a robot whoâ€™s never laughed. So hereâ€™s my mission: help you skip the fluff, find your jam, and savor every page-turning moment. Letâ€™s dive into my favesâ€¦  enjoy. ðŸ“šâœ¨ :-)

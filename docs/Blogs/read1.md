Before reading this, I always thought the real world is far more fascinating than fiction. this is an excellent fiction. writer is genius. 


Dostoevsky's story centers on a deeply disillusioned man who views himself as "ridiculous" due to his perceived failures and the futility of his existence. Consumed by despair, he contemplates suicide, attempting to end his life. Surviving the attempt, he experiences a transformative dream in which he travels to a utopian planet. Here, its inhabitants live in innocence, free from the corruption and suffering plaguing Earth. However, when he shares his knowledge of human vices with them, their paradise collapses into chaos, mirroring humanity's fall from grace. Upon awakening, the protagonist undergoes a profound moral awakening. Recognizing the potential for redemption and goodness in humanity, he dedicates his life to altruism, seeking to alleviate the suffering of others.

This book really inspired me becuse of writer Dostoevsky's writing is exceptionalâ€”I wish I could write my thesis with the same depth and insight. If you're going to read this, I would recommend having a little knowledge about existentialism, the Enlightenment period in Europe, and Christianity (suffering, utopia, etc.), as these themes are central to the narrative. Dostoevsky made me experience something I had lost during the rational and empirical nature of myself.  but still This story moved me to tears when describing the utopian world, evoking feelings. what a wrtier, astonishing skills of story telling, speachless, wao what a observer he was.

## Training Opportunity for Undergraduate Students      [May-2025]
I am excited to announce a new training opportunity designed specifically for noobs in bioinformatics,  or undergraduate students wishing to do a little adventure. This is non-funded project. I want to give it a try. Donâ€™t miss out on this chance to enhance your skills and gain valuable experience!

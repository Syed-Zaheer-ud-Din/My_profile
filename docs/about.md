# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am a PhD student at the University of Science and Technology China, driven by a deep passion for **evolutionary biology**. My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experience in diverse fields, including:

- ðŸ§¬ **Evo-Devo** (Evolutionary Developmental Biology)  
- ðŸ§ª **Genetics**  
- ðŸ¦  **Microbiology**

Currently, my research focuses on leveraging **big data analysis** and cutting-edge **AI tools** to address fundamental questions in **virology**. I am fascinated by the intersection of biology and technology, and I strive to uncover new insights that contribute to our understanding of the natural world.

ðŸŒŸ When Iâ€™m not immersed in research, I enjoy exploring new ideas, collaborating with fellow scientists, and staying curious about the ever-evolving field of biology.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss science, research, or exciting collaborations!
